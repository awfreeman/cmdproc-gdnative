# cmdshim-gdnative

Uses Fenteale's simple gdnative downloader as a base for a better way to spawn processes from GDScript. 

## Building

This is a standard cmake project. It can either be built with command line or loaded directly in visual studio. Command line example is:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

Output libraries will be placed in the `build` folder.
